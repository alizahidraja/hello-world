# hello-world
Starting to understand the basics of github

this project marks the starting of my career here, i can code in python, java, c/c++, c#, linux, swing, mac
i have a good grip and understanding of these and can learn more when required, i started my journey as a freelancer with only the knowledge of loops in c++ but i have learnt alot since then
hope this website will do wonders for me
